The application is implemented with a use of Spring Boot and Java 17.
To run simply run `./mvnw spring-boot:run`. The application starts on port 8080.

I was writing the code from 9:30 PM to 3:00 AM with an hour break to eat and rest (completed mvp)
and from 9:00 PM to 11:00 PM to do the tests.
Please note, I had ZERO prior experience with API development in java and ZERO experience in creating the tests.
90% of the time spent I was doing the researches. Of course I had a ton of transferable experience from C# and .Net.
